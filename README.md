1. Github setup
2. Create a build script in maven and its default source tree boilerplate (I've in plan to experiment gradle)
3. Adding 3 basic domain objects: Item, Receipt and Tax. I'm not sure that is the "right" model
4. Create the main service for the SalesTaxes application
5. Add a unit test to SalesTaxes application
